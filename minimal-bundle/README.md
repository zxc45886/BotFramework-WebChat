# Sample

A simple web page with a maximized Web Chat and minimal additional components.

This build does not contains any additional components that makes Web Chat works in a minimal way. That means, it does not contains the following components:

- Adaptive Cards
- Cognitive Services Bing Speech
- Markdown-It

# How to run

- Run `npx serve`
- Browse to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

# Things to try out

- Type `markdown`, you should see the raw text, instead of rendered Markdown
- Type `card weather`, you should see an error stating Adaptive Cards renderer is not found
